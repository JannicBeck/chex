// | The FEN consists of 6 sections seperated by blanks
// * {Piece placement} {Active colour} {Castling availability} {En passant target square} {Halfmove clock} {Fullmove number}
//
// | Piece placement (from white's perspective)
// * Each rank is described, starting with rank 8 and ending with rank 1.
// * Within each rank, the contents of each square are described from file "a" through file "h".
// * Following the Standard Algebraic Notation (SAN), each piece is identified by a single letter taken from the standard
// * English names (pawn = "P", knight = "N", bishop = "B", rook = "R", queen = "Q" and king = "K").
// * White pieces are designated using upper-case letters ("PNBRQK") while black pieces use lowercase ("pnbrqk").
// * Empty squares are noted using digits 1 through 8 (the number of empty squares), and "/" separates ranks.
//
// | Active colour
// * "w" means White moves next, "b" means Black.
//
// | Castling availability
// * If neither side can castle, this is "-".
// * Otherwise, this has one or more letters: "K" (White can castle kingside),
// * "Q" (White can castle queenside), "k" (Black can castle kingside),
// * and/or "q" (Black can castle queenside).
//
// | En passant target square in algebraic notation
// * If there's no en passant target square, this is "-".
// * If a pawn has just made a two-square move, this is the position "behind" the pawn.
// * This is recorded regardless of whether there is a pawn in position to make an en passant capture.
//
// | Halfmove clock
// * This is the number of halfmoves since the last capture or pawn advance.
// * This is used to determine if a draw can be claimed under the fifty-move rule.
//
// | Fullmove number
// * The number of the full move. It starts at 1, and is incremented after Black's move.
